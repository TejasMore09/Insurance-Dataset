# Insurance-Dataset
This repository contains my submission for Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the insurance.csv dataset. The objective of this task was to analyze the dataset using statistical measures and data visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. I started by loading the dataset and verifying that it had no missing values. Categorical features such as sex, smoker, and region were encoded appropriately using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
Summary statistics including the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum were calculated for all numerical columns to understand the overall distribution. I then created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, such as histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and a correlation heatmap. These visuals helped reveal important insights like medical charges were significantly higher among smokers and charges tended to increase with age and BMI, particularly for smokers.
The analysis showed that smoking status, age, and BMI are the most influential features in determining insurance charges, while variables like region and number of children had minimal impact. The repository includes all the code, the dataset and this README file summarizing the work done.
